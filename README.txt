About Babel3
============

Babel3 is a fork of Babel that is compatible with Python 2.6/2.7 and
3.2/3.3 - using the same python source code without conversion.

Babel is a Python library that provides an integrated collection of
utilities that assist with internationalizing and localizing Python
applications (in particular web-based applications).

Details can be found in the HTML files in the `doc` folder.
